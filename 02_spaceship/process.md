# Spaceship Titanic Challenge

## 1. Problem Definition and Strategy
1.1 Clearly define the problem and objective.
1.2 Understand what the data represents and its characteristics.
1.3 Propose an initial solution.

## 2. Gather the Data
2.1 Seek out the data (datasets)
2.2 Define the data type
2.3 Prepare them for import into notebooks

## 3. Data Loading, Initial Visualization, and Transformation
3.1 Load the data and visualize the first few rows.
3.2 Perform individual transformations.
3.3 Identify and handle null values.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.1 Visualize direct correlation between each Feature and Target.
4.2 Analyze descriptive statistics and distributions.
4.3 Identify and handle inconsistencies and outliers.
4.4 Visualize relationships and correlations between variables.

## 5. Hypotheses and Statistical Testing
5.1 Formulate and document hypotheses.
5.2 Perform statistical tests to validate or refute hypotheses.

## 6. Pre-processing and Feature Engineering
6.1 Create new features based on EDA insights.
6.2 Normalize or standardize features, if necessary.

## 7. Modeling
7.1 Split the data into training and testing sets.
7.2 Select and train initial models.
7.3 Evaluate and compare the performance of the models.
7.4 Hyperparameter tuning and optimization.

## 8. Final Evaluation and Implementation
8.1 Evaluate the final model on a testing or validation set.
8.2 Interpret results and metrics.
8.3 Implement the model to make predictions on new data.

## 9. Documentation and Iteration
9.1 Document the entire process, decisions, results, and metrics.
9.2 Review the methodology and identify areas for improvement.
9.3 Iterate: return to previous steps if necessary to refine the analysis and model.
